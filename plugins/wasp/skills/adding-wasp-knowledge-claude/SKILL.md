## Adding Wasp Knowledge

1. find the project root's CLAUDE.md file.
2. ask the user if they'd like to add the [general-wasp-knowledge.md](./general-wasp-knowledge.md) file to the CLAUDE.md file.
3. if they do, store it in the `.claude/knowledge` directory and link to it from their CLAUDE.md file using the [example-section-link.md](./example-section-link.md) as a guide.
4. inform the user that they can edit their Wasp knowledge file at any time and also use the [cached-docs](../../knowledge/cached-docs) directory to help claude code with Wasp development tasks.
