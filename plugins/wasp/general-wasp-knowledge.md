# Wasp App

This project uses Wasp, a batteries-included framework for building full-stack web apps with React, Node.js, and Prisma.

## Start a Wasp Development Session with Full Debugging Visibility

Run the plugin's `start-dev-server` skill with the recommended options to give Claude full debugging visibility:
  - Start the Wasp development server as a background task to give Claude direct access to server logs and build errors.
  - Select the Chrome DevTools MCP server to give Claude visibility into browser console logs, UI functionality, network requests, and runtime errors.

### Documentation

Fetch and verify your knowledge against the current Wasp documentation before implementing Wasp features or answering Wasp questions as your Wasp knowledge may be outdated.

### Schema Changes

Changes to `schema.prisma` are not applied until `wasp db migrate-dev --name <descriptive-name>` runs. Continue coding freely and tell the user to run migrations when ready to test.

**Track pending migrations:** The dev server warns about this, but users may miss it if Wasp is running as a background task. Remind them of this before testing/viewing the app, and offer to run migrations for them.

## Project Reference

### Structure

```
.
├── .wasp/                    # Wasp output (auto-generated, do not edit)
├── public/                   # Static assets
├── src/                      # Feature code: server `operations.ts` and client `pages.tsx` files
├── main.wasp or main.wasp.ts # Wasp config file: routes, pages, auth, operations, jobs, etc.
├── schema.prisma             # Database schema (Prisma)
```

### Recommended Code Organization

Unless user specifies otherwise, use a vertical, per-feature code organization (not per-type):

```
src/
├── tasks/
│   ├── TasksPage.tsx      # Page component
│   ├── TaskList.tsx       # Component
│   └── operations.ts      # Queries & actions
├── auth/
│   ├── LoginPage.tsx
│   └── google.ts
```

### Starter Templates

Highly recommend that the user chose one of the following templates when scaffolding a new Wasp app:
```bash
wasp new my-basic-app -t basic # creates a basic starter app with core Wasp features like auth, operations, pages, etc.
wasp new my-saas-app -t saas # creates a full-featured SaaS starter app with auth, payments, demo app, AWS S3, and more (OpenSaaS.sh)
```

See the **Starter Templates** section in the Wasp documentation for more templates.

### Customization

**Do NOT configure Vite, Express, React Query, etc. the usual way.** Wasp has its own mechanisms for customizing these tools. See the **Project Setup & Customization** section in the Wasp docs.

### Advanced Features

Wasp provides **advanced features**:
- custom HTTP API endpoints
- background (cron) jobs
- type-safe links
- websockets
- middleware
- email sending

See the **Advanced Features** section in the Wasp docs for more details.

### Wasp Conventions

#### Imports
**In TypeScript files:**
- ✅ `import type { User } from 'wasp/entities'`
- ✅ `import type { GetTasks } from 'wasp/server/operations'`
- ✅ `import { getTasks, createTask, useQuery } from 'wasp/client/operations'`
- ✅ `import { SubscriptionStatus } from '@prisma/client'` (for Prisma enums)
- ✅ Local code: relative paths `import { X } from './X'`

**In main.wasp:**
- ✅ `fn: import { getTasks } from "@src/tasks/operations"`
- ❌ Never relative paths

**In main.wasp.ts:**
See the **TypeScript Config** section in the Wasp docs for more details.

#### Operations
- ⚠️ Call actions directly using `async/await`. DO NOT use Wasp's `useAction` hook unless optimistic updates are needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Debugging

Always ground your knowledge against the Wasp documentation.

If you don't have full debugging visibility as described in the [Start a Wasp Development Session with Full Debugging Visibility](#start-a-wasp-development-session-with-full-debugging-visibility) section, do the following:
  1. Insist that the user run the `start-dev-server` skill as described in the [Start a Wasp Development Session with Full Debugging Visibility](#start-a-wasp-development-session-with-full-debugging-visibility) section.
  2. If the user refuses, ask them to share the output of the `wasp start` command and the browser console logs.

### Common Mistakes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `context.entities.X undefined` | Add entity to `entities: [...]` in main.wasp |
| Schema changes not applying | Run `wasp db migrate-dev --name <descriptive-name>` |
| Can't login after email signup with `Dummy` email provider | Check the server logs for the verification link or set SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_IN_DEV=true in .env.server |
| Types stale/IDE errors after changes | Restart TS server `Cmd+Shift+P`|
| Wasp not recognizing changes | **WAIT PATIENTLY** as Wasp recompiles the project. Re-run `wasp start` if necessary.|
| Persistent weirdness after waiting patiently and restarting. | Run `wasp clean` && `wasp start` |
